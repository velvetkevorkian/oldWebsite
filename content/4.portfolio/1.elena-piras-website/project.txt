This is actually the second site I've designed for [Elena Piras](http://elenapiras.com/), a singer/songwiter originally from Sardinia but now based in Scotland.
The first and second versions of were static HTML, which meant updating news and upcoming shows was difficult and time consuming. Instead,
I built a custom Wordpress theme which kept the look and feel of the previous sites but made better use of space and new technologies 
to make it easy to maintain without having to code it.

The website is live now at [elenapiras.com](http://elenapiras.com/).
