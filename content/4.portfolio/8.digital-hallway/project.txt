I co-designed/developed this site for the joint Product/Interaction design exhibition held in January 2013. The site takes its cues from the presentation of the exhibition itself. Each project belongs to one of two themes, one with blue and one with brown wallpaper as an accent. We tried to make the branding as consistent as possible across all the material we created. 

Exhibition branding:

I implemented the site based on designs by [Tom Kinnear](http://interaction.dundee.ac.uk/~tkinnear/wordpress/). These are Tom's original Photoshop comps:

I substantially reworked and simplified the information structure of the site from what we originally proposed. These two pages were combined into a single dropdown accessible from any page:

The site was designed and built in the space of about a fortnight, with the entire structure, content and visual design generated in the first week and the second for styling and testing, and was built from the start to be responsive. 
It's online at [socialdigital.dundee.ac.uk/digitalhallway](http://socialdigital.dundee.ac.uk/digitalhallway/); the piece I contributed to in the exhibition was [Traffic State](@root_path/portfolio/traffic-state/).
