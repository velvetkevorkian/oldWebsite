	Need more info? Want to know the gritty details of my school exams? [Get in touch](../contact/).
	
- ###Experience
	See my [portfolio](../portfolio/) for the interesting stuff. If you're reading this you're probably not that interested in the 
	selection of menial jobs I've had over the years. If you are, [ask me](../contact/) and I'll tell you. 
	
- ###Tools
	I love Processing. 
	
	I've played with OpenFrameworks on the desktop and iOS, and dabbled in Arduino.
	
	I'm experienced with most of the Adobe CS software. For audio, I like Reaper.
	
	I'm comfortable on Windows and OSX. By comfortable, I mean I hate them both equally.
	
- ### This site 
	is running on Stacey, and was built with the help of SASS and Processing.js. I hand-coded it in TextWrangler.  
	The blog uses Wordpress, and at the time of writing is pretty ugly. Sorry.
